  To understand the example below, read in this order:
  - First Iteration (3 comments)
  - Second Iteration (3 comments)
  - Third Iteration (1 commented, but follows the 2nd iteration logic)
  - Fourth Iteration (4 comments)
  - Fifth Iteration

  Read following the indexes of the iteration, like:
  1- First Iteration
  2- First Iteration
  and so on...
  These indexes represent the order of the iteration, it'll help in your comprehension.
